mangadownloader-java
====================

A java console app for downloading manga chapters, currently it works scrapping the images out of mangareader.net website. Currently it is an interactive console, you run it like this.
java -jar mdownloader
It will ask your for the necesary data to download the chapters, it needs:
1- Folder where the chapters will be downloaded to.
2- Name of the manga, this name must match the name in the mangareader.net url, for example: http://www.mangareader.net/naruto/689
here naruto will be the name you must enter.
3- initial chapter number, for example 600, this number is included in the download.
4- final chapter number, for example 605, this number is included in the download.

Hopefully this will help manga fans around the world and in the near future I hope to make it an Android app.
